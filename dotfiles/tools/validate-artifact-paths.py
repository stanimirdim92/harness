"""Guard the spec -> plan -> build -> review -> ship pipeline against artifact-path drift.

`/spec` and `/plan` write artifacts that `/build`, `/test`, `/review`, `/ship`,
the two pipeline skills, and the quality gates read back by path. When one side
renames or moves an artifact and the other keeps the old spelling, the pipeline
breaks silently -- a stage reports "no spec found" against a spec that exists.
This repo already shipped one such drift: the command wrote `[TICKET]-SPEC.md`
while the skill said `[TICKET]-spec.md` (fixed in c4584dd). Nothing checked it.

One canonical set of artifact paths, enforced across every file that defines
the pipeline. Changing the convention means editing ALLOWED and every guarded
file in the same change; this check fails until they agree.

Scope is deliberately narrow: only spec/capability-map/plan/todo artifacts, only
pipeline files. It is not a general markdown path linter; cross-references to
other harness documents (`../references/spec-quality-gates.md`,
`templates/spec.md`) are ignored by construction, see is_artifact_candidate().

Adapted from addyosmani/agent-skills scripts/validate-artifact-paths.js; the
difference is that our paths carry a `[TICKET]` placeholder and a module-id
suffix, so the allowlist is a set of patterns rather than literal strings.

Exit 0 when clean, 1 on any drifted path.
