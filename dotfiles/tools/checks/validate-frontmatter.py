"""Guard the persona frontmatter and settings that carry the harness's enforcement.

Every guarantee in dotfiles/docs/adr/0055 lives in a YAML block or a settings key, and
nothing checked that the block still says what the ADR claims:

- Reviewers are read-only **by tool grant**, not by instruction. A persona that
  loses its `tools:` line inherits everything, including `Agent` and `Bash` --
  the exact hole 0055 closed. A reviewer that gains `Write`/`Edit`/`Bash` is
  read-only in prose only.
- The writing personas carry the three agent-scoped hooks (`block-agent-push.sh`,
  `require-commit-trailers.sh`, `require-handoff-report.sh`). Delete a `hooks:` block by accident and the
  push denial, the trailer rule and the handoff gate silently stop existing; dotfiles/tools/tests/test-hooks.sh
  and dotfiles/tools/tests/test-handoff-hook.sh still pass, because the hooks themselves are
  fine -- nobody is calling them.
- The spawn-depth, agent-teams and fork pins in settings.json are single lines
  whose absence restores a default that undoes the design (0055 follow-up).

This is a shape check on the declarations, not a behavioral test: it proves the
frontmatter still says what the ADR says, not that the runtime honours it.
Same reasoning as 0049 -- a guardrail nothing tests is a guardrail nobody has
checked.

Exit 0 when clean, 1 on any violation.
