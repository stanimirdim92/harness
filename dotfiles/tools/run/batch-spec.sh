# Run `/spec` for many tickets, one worktree per job, and stop at the spec gate.
#
# Specs are the one pipeline stage that fans out for free: `/spec` reads Jira and
# the repository and writes one markdown file. It runs no migrations, binds no
# port and touches no shared mutable state, so the conditions commands/build.md
# puts on concurrent writers do not apply to it. Building is a different
# question and this script deliberately does not go there -- every job stops
# with a Draft spec awaiting a human.
#
# A job is one line of the manifest: comma-separated tickets, optional slug.

#
# Tickets that share files belong on one line. Four separate specs over one
# normalization path each propose their own helper, which is how a codebase
# ends up with three competing ones (CLAUDE.md rule 6).
#
#   -m, --manifest FILE  job list (default: spec-batch.txt next to this script)
#   -p, --parallel N     concurrent jobs (default 1; they share one rate limit)
#   -b, --budget USD     --max-budget-usd per CLI call (default 5); a job that
#                        is resumed (below) can make up to three calls
#   -o, --out DIR        logs and run metadata (default: .spec-batch/)
#   -n, --dry-run        print the plan and exit
#   -y, --yes            skip the confirmation
#
# A headless run can end its turn with a progress report and no spec -- the
# early stop Anthropic's Opus 5.5 guide describes for unattended agents. When a
# job exits 0 without a spec for its tickets, the same session is resumed with
# a nudge, at most MAX_CONTINUATIONS times, so a genuinely stuck job still ends
# and reports NO SPEC.
#
# Exits 1 when declined or when any job fails.
