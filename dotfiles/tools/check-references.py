"""Resolve every cross-reference between harness files and fail on a broken one.

The pipeline is held together by relative links: `/plan` reads
`../references/plan-quality-gates.md`, a skill reads `../../references/
definition-of-done.md`, a reference points at `templates/task.md`. They resolve
from the physical directory of the file that names them, symlink or not
(ARCHITECTURE.md, "Installation and reads"). Nothing checked that the target on
the other end exists.

The failure this guards against is quiet. A stage that cannot read its own
reference does not crash -- it proceeds from the skill body alone and produces
an artifact that was never shaped by the template or checked against the quality
gates. Observed on 2026-09-14: `/plan` ran a full precondition check with
plan-quality-gates.md, templates/plan.md and templates/task.md all unread, and
disclosed it in a footnote (dotfiles/docs/observation-log.md).

Scope, deliberately narrow: markdown links and backticked paths that begin with
`./`, `../` or `templates/` -- the cross-reference class. Artifact paths carrying
a `[TICKET]` placeholder belong to dotfiles/tools/validate-artifact-paths.py and are
skipped here; so are URLs and bare filenames, which are prose more often than
links.

The harness's own docs (dotfiles/ARCHITECTURE.md, dotfiles/README.md,
dotfiles/docs/*.md) are scanned too, but only their markdown links, which there
are relative to the file (`claude/AGENTS.md`) rather than `./`-prefixed.
ARCHITECTURE.md's ownership table pointed at the deleted dotfiles/claude/CLAUDE.md
for a week because nothing outside dotfiles/claude was checked.
dotfiles/docs/adr/ is excluded: an ADR is a dated record, and a path it names
may be gone by design.

This is the static half. A reference that resolves but is refused at runtime --
a permission denial on a path outside the session's working directory -- is not
visible from here.

Exit 0 when every reference resolves, 1 otherwise.
