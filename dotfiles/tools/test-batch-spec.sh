# A repository in the state real ones are in, not a pristine one. Two of the

# *-SPEC.md was reported as this job's output, and a job whose worktree could
# not be created vanished from the results. Neither could happen in a repo with
# no prior specs and no branches. So every case gets:
#   - a spec from some earlier ticket, committed;
#   - an unrelated branch, so branch-name collisions are reachable;
#   - an untracked file, because a working checkout is never clean;
#   - a stale prunable worktree entry, the state `rm -rf` leaves behind.
