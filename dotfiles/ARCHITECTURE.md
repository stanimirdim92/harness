# Dotfiles harness architecture

This repository maintains shared agent workflows and installs them into Claude
Code and Codex. It contains instructions, adapters, configuration, and checking
utilities; the host application executes the workflows. Installation instructions
and the full synced-file inventory live in [README.md](README.md).

## Source ownership

| Source | Owns |
|---|---|
| [dotfiles/claude/AGENTS.md](claude/AGENTS.md) | Shared global defaults; project-local rules may be more specific |
| [dotfiles/claude/commands](claude/commands) | Workflow entry points, orchestration, evidence gates, and stopping conditions |
| [dotfiles/claude/skills](claude/skills) | Reusable methodology, including project documentation |
| [dotfiles/claude/agents](claude/agents) | Persona responsibilities, Claude tool/model declarations, and report contracts |
| [dotfiles/claude/references](claude/references) | Shared gate definitions, templates, and supporting guidance |
| [dotfiles/claude/docs/agents.md](claude/docs/agents.md) | Human-readable orchestration overview, linked to the owning commands |
| [dotfiles/codex/skills](codex/skills) | Thin Codex entry points into shared commands and skills |
| [dotfiles/codex/references/workflow-runtime.md](codex/references/workflow-runtime.md) | Codex invocation, explicit skill loading, and persona dispatch adaptation |
| [docs/adr](docs/adr) | This repository's accepted architectural decisions and rejected alternatives |

Methodology is maintained in the shared Claude tree. Codex adapters refer to that
source rather than maintaining a second version of the workflow. A shared edit
therefore affects both hosts; a Codex-specific runtime translation belongs in the
adapter/reference. Descriptions and invocation metadata still need reconciliation
when a shared skill's discovery contract changes.

## Installation and reads

[dotfiles/tools/link_dotfiles.sh](tools/link_dotfiles.sh) links the Claude directories and
configuration into the user's home and links the global rules to Codex's
`AGENTS.md`. It preflights every destination (including the Codex adapter
links below) before mutating anything, refuses to overwrite an existing
`.bak`, and reverts paths changed by the current run if a later link fails.
Its general link helper backs up existing real files and replaces old
symlinks; review its output when moving an installation.

The script calls [dotfiles/codex/install-skills.py](codex/install-skills.py)
for individual Codex skill links under `~/.agents/skills`. That installer checks
all destination conflicts first and refuses to replace an existing unrelated
path. Repeated installation preserves correct links; `--check` only checks link
state. It leaves bundled Codex system skills and other user skills in place.

The resulting read paths are:

```text
Claude skill/command -> ~/.claude/... -> dotfiles/claude/... -> shared references
Codex $skill -> ~/.agents/skills/<name> -> dotfiles/codex/skills/<name>
            -> shared Claude source + Codex runtime conventions
```

Relative references resolve from each source file's physical directory, including
when reached through a symlink. Keeping sources in the checkout preserves their
sibling references, templates, and license files. Machine-specific credentials,
logs, databases, and session state are outside this synced architecture; see the
README's exclusions. Editing a linked runtime file edits its repository source.

## Workflow and project boundaries

The pipeline is `spec -> plan -> build -> review -> ship`, with independent
`test` verification when requested or required by review. Commands own the gates;
personas perform bounded work and do not dispatch other personas. The details,
including executor reuse and concurrency, live in
[the orchestration guide](claude/docs/agents.md) and its command sources.

Ticket specs, plans, task packets, and project documentation belong to the target
project. Global skills supply their workflow and shape without becoming a copy of
project-specific facts. [project-docs](claude/skills/project-docs/SKILL.md)
can generate or refresh a useful document set independently of the ticket stages;
[documentation practices](claude/references/documentation-practices.md#project-documentation)
defines document ownership and change-driven maintenance.

## Host enforcement and integrations

Claude's [settings](claude/settings.json) configure PreToolUse hooks from
[dotfiles/claude/hooks](claude/hooks) and pin the subagent spawn depth
to 1, so no persona can dispatch another; persona frontmatter declares its
Claude tools, models, turn caps, and — for the writing personas — agent-scoped
hooks that deny pushing and gate the handoff report. Those declarations are not Codex enforcement. Codex's
own sandbox, approvals, and available tools determine its actual capabilities;
the runtime adapter passes persona constraints as instructions and uses available
Codex delegation. A textual restriction is not an OS permission boundary.

Concurrent writers require separate checkouts and isolated runtimes; `/build`
fans out whenever those conditions are established and queues a workstream
when any is unproven. Review and verification contexts remain independent from executors.
Missing required tools or delegation produce an explicit blocker.

MCP connections and authentication remain host-specific. A linked browser, Jira,
or architecture skill does not establish a working connection. The Claude
[MCP setup script](claude/mcp/setup.sh) is separate from link installation;
Codex tools must be available in its own session.

## Map

[dotfiles/docs/harness-map.html](docs/harness-map.html) draws every layer -- pipeline,
session boot, personas, enforcement, references, skills, self-tests, records --
as one sheet. Open it in a browser; GitHub will not render it.
[dotfiles/tools/harness-map.py](tools/harness-map.py) generates it from the files that
own each fact (agent frontmatter, command frontmatter, `settings.json`, hook
headers, skill frontmatter, the CI workflow, the ADRs). Do not edit it by hand.
When a persona, hook, command, skill, reference or CI step changes, run the
generator in the same change; CI fails on a stale map.

## Verification and maintenance

Fixtures are built in the state a working checkout is actually in, not a
pristine one. Every repository fixture carries a spec from an earlier ticket,
an unrelated branch, an untracked file and a prunable worktree entry; every
`$HOME` fixture carries files the linker does not manage. Three of the five
findings in an external review of `81515f3` hid behind clean fixtures: an
inherited spec reported as a job's own output, a worker that vanished from the
results, and a gate counting a `rm -rf`-ed worktree. None was reachable in a
repository with no prior specs, no branches and no stale worktrees.

- `python3 dotfiles/codex/install-skills.py --check` checks installed link targets.
- `dotfiles/tools/test-install-skills.py` regression-tests the installer's preflight and
  rollback behavior (conflict detection, injected-failure rollback) in a
  temporary destination, without touching real links.
- `dotfiles/tools/test-link-dotfiles.sh` runs `link_dotfiles.sh` against a throwaway
  `$HOME` and checks the filesystem afterwards, so a declined run has to prove
  it changed nothing rather than prove it printed a warning. Covers decline,
  non-terminal stdin, dry run, `--yes`, whole-directory backup, and the
  silent no-op re-run.
- `dotfiles/tools/test-batch-spec.sh` covers `batch-spec.sh` with `claude` stubbed --
  manifest parsing, the already-specced skip, decline, non-terminal stdin, dry
  run, per-job failure, `.worktreeinclude` copying, and that each job runs
  *inside* its worktree. That last one caught the real bug: the branch was
  created and the spec written to the main checkout.
- `dotfiles/tools/test-hooks.sh` exercises the Claude command hooks with fixtures;
  `dotfiles/tools/test-handoff-hook.sh` does the same for the `SubagentStop` handoff gate.
- `dotfiles/tools/test-isolated-test-runner.sh` covers the gate that denies a bare
  `php artisan test`/`phpunit` when the project ships `bin/worktree-test.sh`
  and more than one worktree is live. Both evidence gates, the command-position
  anchor, the env-assignment prefix and the `test:` boundary each have a case
  that fails when removed.
- `dotfiles/tools/test-worktree-hooks.sh` covers the worktree-base and infrastructure
  readiness guards (ADR 0057/0058) against real Git fixtures and stub project
  doctors. Cases include safe feature/linked checkouts, malformed input, missing
  tools, detached HEAD, paths with spaces, and mid-ticket runner drift. The writer
  guard's cases assert the `permissionDecision` it returns, never an exit
  status: the first version asserted `exit 2` from a `SubagentStart` hook,
  which passes whether or not that event can block anything.
- `dotfiles/tools/test-run-metrics.sh` runs `dotfiles/tools/run-metrics.sh` on a fabricated
  transcript and checks its large-result section: threshold default and
  override, time window, subagent exclusion, string and array-form results.
- `dotfiles/tools/validate-frontmatter.py` fails when a persona loses its explicit
  `tools:` line, a read-only persona gains a mutating or dispatching tool, a
  writing persona stops referencing its two agent-scoped hooks, the verifier
  loses `isolation: worktree`, an executor gains unconditional isolation, a
  persona drifts off the model tier its role calls for,
  or a `settings.json` pin from ADR 0055 or 0056 is missing;
  `dotfiles/tools/validate-frontmatter-test.py` covers the allow and deny cases.
- `dotfiles/tools/validate-artifact-paths.py` fails when any pipeline file spells a
  spec/capability-map/plan/todo artifact path differently from the canonical
  set (the drift class fixed in c4584dd); `dotfiles/tools/validate-artifact-paths-test.py`
  covers the allow and deny cases.
- [Spec eval](tools/tests/spec-eval/README.md) re-runs `/spec` against a ticket
  whose right answer is known from a human reading its spec against what
  shipped, and checks the known findings survive. It is the only check here
  that can tell whether a harness change moved spec *quality* rather than
  shape. Its judging half is deterministic and runs in CI; producing a spec
  costs tokens and is run deliberately. Fixtures carry real ticket content and
  are gitignored.
- [Plan recall](tools/tests/plan-recall/README.md) scores a shipped ticket's
  plan against its merged change: the share of changed files the plan's tasks
  named. It measures the plan's change surface (`plan-quality-gates.md` §4),
  costs no tokens, and its scoring logic runs in CI. Score with `--ticket`
  when the range carries other work.
- [Workflow checks](tools/tests/workflow/README.md) document the isolated
  Jira/spec/plan/build/review runner, its invocation, and what its evidence
  does not cover.
- `dotfiles/tools/check-references.py` resolves every relative cross-reference between
  harness files and fails on one that no longer exists; `dotfiles/tools/check-references-test.py`
  covers the resolution and the placeholder/URL cases it must not flag. It is the
  static half of the reference problem — a reference refused at runtime because
  it resolves outside the session's working directory is not visible to it.
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs every check above on each push to `main` and each pull request. The live
  workflow runner is excluded on purpose: it drives the real model and spends
  tokens, so it stays a deliberate manual run.
- `dotfiles/docs/observation-log.md` records what real runs actually cost and where they
  failed. It is the evidence the uncalibrated numbers — `maxTurns` above all —
  are waiting on, and the input the ADRs are meant to be argued from.
- Changed instructions need focused behavioral checks when their decisions or
  orchestration change; syntax and valid paths alone do not establish behavior.

Update this overview when ownership, installation paths, host adaptation, or
execution boundaries change. Keep detailed policy in its existing source and
link to it here. Record genuine new architectural choices in the ADRs.
