# Architecture Decision Records

One file per decision — why this repo's `.claude` config is built the way
it is, including choices reversed after contact with reality. Format and
the difference from `docs/IDEAS.md` (unjudged) is defined in
`dotfiles/claude/references/documentation-practices.md`; don't duplicate
that explanation here, just the index.

Adding a new decision: create the next-numbered `NNNN-kebab-title.md`
(4-digit, zero-padded — MADR-style, matches the files already here) and
add one row here. If it reverses an earlier entry, leave that entry's
text as-is, mark its Status column "Superseded by NNNN", and state the
reversal in the new entry instead of editing the old one.
