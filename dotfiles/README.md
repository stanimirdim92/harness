# AI tool dotfiles (Claude Code / Codex)

`dotfiles/` holds the syncable config from `~/.claude` and `~/.codex`. On a
machine, `dotfiles/tools/setup/link_dotfiles.sh` symlinks these into place (backing up any
existing real file as `<name>.bak` the first time). Re-run it any time,
including right after `git clone` on a new machine:

    ./dotfiles/tools/setup/link_dotfiles.sh

It prints what each destination will become — `new`, `relink`, `backup`, or
`ok` — and asks before touching anything. Six of the destinations are whole
directories (`agents`, `skills`, `hooks`, `commands`, `references`, `docs`); a
real one is moved aside to `<name>.bak` intact rather than merged, so the plan
marks those `BACKUP` with their entry count. `--dry-run` prints the plan and
stops; `--yes` skips the prompt and is required when stdin is not a terminal.
A re-run with nothing to do says so and does not prompt.

For independent Codex CLI sessions, run `codex-worktree LD-123` from anywhere
inside a project. It creates `<main-checkout>/.codex/worktrees/LD-123` on
`codex/LD-123`, or reopens that ticket's checkout without resetting it. Open
another terminal and run `codex-worktree LD-124` for concurrent work. Each gets
its own files, branch, and Codex session; a per-ticket lock prevents duplicate
launcher sessions in the same checkout. These are persistent CLI worktrees,
separate from the desktop app's managed worktrees.

New ticket branches start from the invoking checkout's committed `HEAD`; update
your base first. Existing ticket branches retain their own history. Uncommitted
source changes stay in their original checkout. The launcher copies only files
that are both ignored and selected by `.worktreeinclude`, keeps existing target
files, and skips source symlinks. It then runs the shared infrastructure guard
and the project's executable `bin/worktree-setup.sh`, when present, before
starting `codex -C <ticket-checkout>`. Leadbuster's setup reconciles its own
dependency copies; its test runner owns database/Redis isolation. Worktrees do
not isolate development servers, fixed ports, or other shared services.

Use `codex-worktree --dry-run LD-123` to inspect without changes, or
`codex-worktree --no-setup LD-123` for specification/planning without dependency
setup. Pass Codex arguments after `--`, e.g. `codex-worktree LD-123 -- -m gpt-6-astra`.
Setup failures stop before Codex and retain the checkout for repair/retry.
Worktrees remain after exit; use the project's cleanup procedure and
`git worktree remove` when a ticket is finished. The launcher locally excludes
`/.codex/worktrees/` through `.git/info/exclude`, without editing project files.
See [ADR 0061](docs/adr/0061-codex-cli-ticket-worktree-launcher.md).

`dotfiles/tools/run/batch-spec.sh` runs `/spec` for many tickets at once, one worktree per
job, reading `dotfiles/tools/run/spec-batch.txt`. Tickets that share files go on one line so
they get one spec rather than four competing ones. It stops at the spec gate:
every job ends with a Draft spec, uncommitted, awaiting a human. `--dry-run`
prints the plan, `--parallel N` widens it, `--budget` caps each job. Where the
project declares `.worktreeinclude`, the matching ignored files are copied into
each worktree — `git worktree add` is not `claude --worktree` and does not do
that itself.

`dotfiles/tools/run/run-metrics.sh` reports measured run metrics from a Claude Code
transcript — tool-call batching, token totals, main-session vs subagent split,
main-session tool results over a line threshold (whole files read inline), and
failure signals (errored and denied tool results, handoff-gate blocks, turn
caps, repeated commands) — with `--since`/`--until` to scope a single `/build`
and `--row` to print a ready observation-log row. See
`dotfiles/claude/references/agent-run-metrics.md`.

`dotfiles/tools/evals/plan-recall/recall.py` scores a shipped ticket's plan
against what changed: the share of changed files its tasks named. Run it from
the project checkout:

```bash
python3 ~/path/to/setup_scripts/dotfiles/tools/evals/plan-recall/recall.py --repo ./ \
    --ticket LD-380 --subject-only --show-commits \
    --plan docs/tasks/LD-380-plan.md --plan docs/tasks/LD-380-todo.md \
    --range <commit before the ticket>..<last commit of the ticket>
```

Check the `scored commits` list before trusting the number, then record it in
`dotfiles/docs/observation-log.md` §Plan recall. Options and how to read the
result: `dotfiles/tools/evals/plan-recall/README.md`.

`dotfiles/tools/README.md` lists every tool by folder. `.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs every deterministic check in `dotfiles/tools/` on each
push to `main` and each pull request — hooks, handoff gate, persona frontmatter and settings pins, artifact
paths, workflow-runner logic, the Codex installer, and the metrics script. The
live workflow runner is excluded; it spends tokens and stays a manual run.
Real-run evidence — failures, cost, turns — goes in `dotfiles/docs/observation-log.md`.

This repo's own build decisions (why an agent is configured one way and
not another, including choices reversed after contact with reality) are
recorded in `dotfiles/docs/adr/*.md` — read that before re-proposing
something already tried and rejected here.

Architecture and source ownership: [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md).

To document another project, open a session in that project and use
`/project-docs` in Claude or `$project-docs` in Codex. The default selects a small
useful set; add `full set` for architecture, design, conventions, commands,
testing, security, and a repository map. Use `refresh ARCHITECTURE.md TESTING.md`
to update selected files. The skill reads the project's source and existing
rules; it does not copy Leadbuster's architecture into other projects.

Synced:
- `dotfiles/codex/bin/codex-worktree` -> `~/.local/bin/codex-worktree` — one independent terminal Codex session per ticket worktree; requires `~/.local/bin` on `PATH`.
- `dotfiles/claude/AGENTS.md` -> `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` and `~/.claude/AGENTS.md` — one canonical source for global working rules. Claude 2.1.277+ supports project `AGENTS.md`; its documented global entry point remains `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`, which links directly to this source.
- `dotfiles/claude/settings.json` -> `~/.claude/settings.json` — model, permissions, hooks, active plugins, and context settings. The OS sandbox is **off** (`dotfiles/docs/adr/0085-sandbox-off-credential-read-denials.md`): its bubblewrap network setup failed on the owner's machine (`bwrap: loopback: Failed RTM_NEWADDR`). `permissions.deny` keeps `Read` denials for `~/.ssh`, `~/.aws`, `~/.config/gh`, `~/.git-credentials` and the Docker, npm, Composer, Claude and Codex credential files; they stop a file read, not a shell command such as `cat`. Built-in automatic memory is **enabled** (`autoMemoryEnabled: true`) alongside versioned `docs/MEMORY.md` and the episodic conversation-search plugin, and the auto-compact window is 500k — both reverse `dotfiles/docs/adr/0037-fixed-session-context-reduced.md`; see `dotfiles/docs/adr/0043-automatic-memory-and-compaction-window-restored.md` for the reversal and the precedence rule that resolves the three memory surfaces
- `dotfiles/claude/remote-settings.json` -> `~/.claude/remote-settings.json`
- `dotfiles/claude/statusline.sh` -> `~/.claude/statusline.sh` — status line script wired via `settings.json`'s `statusLine.command`: model name, cwd, git branch, context-usage bar, session cost, elapsed time
- `dotfiles/claude/subagent-statusline.sh` -> `~/.claude/subagent-statusline.sh` — per-subagent row override wired via `settings.json`'s `subagentStatusLine.command`: status icon, name, model, token count/percentage, elapsed time
- `dotfiles/claude/agents/` -> `~/.claude/agents/` (whole directory) — custom subagents: `distributed-systems-reviewer` (timeouts/idempotent retries/backoff/circuit breakers/backpressure/checkpointing, for anything crossing a process/network/queue boundary), `executor` (dispatched by `/build` to implement one task end-to-end; never invokes another agent), `repo-recon` (read-only survey dispatched by `/spec` and `/plan` so the recon reads stay in the agent's own context and only a pointer report returns — see `dotfiles/docs/adr/0041-recon-delegated-to-repo-recon-subagent.md`) — first-party — plus vendored `code-reviewer` (five-axis review), `blind-reviewer` (reviews the diff without the spec or plan, so it reports what the change appears to do), `security-auditor` (vulnerability detection, threat modeling, and hardening across input handling, auth, data protection, infra, third-party integrations, and LLM/OWASP-LLM-Top-10 surfaces — see `dotfiles/docs/adr/0025-security-auditor-provenance-corrected.md` for its actual addyosmani origin, which superseded `infra-reviewer`/`security-reviewer`), and `test-engineer` (dispatched by `/test` as the bounded verifier when `/review` requires the VERIFY gate; also answers direct test-design/coverage-analysis requests) — all three MIT-licensed, see `dotfiles/claude/skills/ADDYOSMANI_AGENT_SKILLS_LICENSE`. The former `ai-engineer`/`prompt-engineer`/`vector-database-engineer` personas (production LLM app/RAG/agent architecture, prompt optimization, vector search/embedding) come from the installed and globally enabled `llm-application-dev@claude-code-workflows` plugin — see `dotfiles/docs/adr/0018-llm-application-dev-switched-to-installed-plugin.md`
- `dotfiles/claude/skills/` -> `~/.claude/skills/` (whole directory) — first-party `dotfiles-sync`, `adr-recording`, `jira-ticket`, `c4-architecture`, `project-docs`, and `executor-development-discipline`; vendored `spec-driven-development`, `planning-and-task-breakdown`, `incremental-implementation`, `test-driven-development`, `code-review-and-quality`, `git-workflow-and-versioning`, `deprecation-and-migration`, `security-and-hardening`, `api-and-interface-design`, and `browser-testing-with-devtools` (selected by `/build`/`/test` as a materially required task-specific skill for browser-facing work, and by `test-engineer`) under `ADDYOSMANI_AGENT_SKILLS_LICENSE`. Frontend skills vendored at pinned commits: `vercel-composition-patterns` (React component APIs, from vercel-labs/agent-skills, `VERCEL_AGENT_SKILLS_LICENSE`) and `vite` / `vitest` (generated from the official docs by antfu/skills, `ANTFU_SKILLS_LICENSE`). Figma's `figma-design-to-code` is fetched, not committed — its repository has no licence — by `dotfiles/tools/setup/fetch-figma-skill.sh` (which `mcp/setup.sh` runs after adding the Figma server) into a gitignored folder, hash-checked against a pinned commit; see `dotfiles/docs/adr/0072-frontend-skills-vendored-and-figma-fetched.md`. The full incremental and review skills remain available for explicit use — each sets `disable-model-invocation: true`, so they load only on `/skill-name` — while `/review` uses `code-reviewer` (`dotfiles/docs/adr/0039-runtime-catalog-narrowed-by-observed-use.md`). `test-driven-development` is on again and preloaded into every executor beside `executor-development-discipline`, which keeps only what is specific to `/build` (`dotfiles/docs/adr/0083-tdd-skill-back-in-the-executor.md`)
- `dotfiles/claude/commands/` -> `~/.claude/commands/` (whole directory) — `/spec`, `/plan`: short aliases into the SDLC skills above; the back half of the chain is a gated split (`dotfiles/docs/adr/0020-build-test-review-pipeline-split.md`) — `/build` groups tasks into workstreams, selects `executor-development-discipline` plus any materially required task-specific skills, and dispatches one `executor` per workstream (resumed across that workstream's later tasks instead of a fresh spawn per task; concurrency has no fixed cap — one executor per workstream that is genuinely independent, dependency-ready, worktree-isolated, runtime-isolated for every mutable resource its checks touch, and within rate-limit headroom, with the rest queued, since two writers in one checkout race on git state regardless of file-scope overlap and a worktree isolates git but not a shared database or queue — `dotfiles/docs/adr/0031-parallel-executors-via-worktree-isolation.md`, `dotfiles/docs/adr/0054-executor-concurrency-condition-gated-not-capped.md`), implements only, no review/verify/verdict; `/review` is the independent REVIEW gate after `/build` — it decides whether independent verification is required for the candidate (`references/verification-triggers.md`; `/test` is risk-triggered, not mandatory — `dotfiles/docs/adr/0035-independent-verify-made-risk-triggered.md`), then fans out `code-reviewer`/`security-auditor`/`distributed-systems-reviewer` (only `code-reviewer` is unconditional; the rest trigger per `references/reviewer-triggers.md`) capped at 2 concurrent reviewers with no exception, and reports findings mapped to canonical BLOCKER/REQUIRED/ADVISORY dispositions (`dotfiles/docs/adr/0033-canonical-disposition-and-scoped-commit-authority.md`); `/test`, when required, dispatches `test-engineer` and reports VERIFY PASS/FAIL/BLOCKED; `/ship` is the final gate after `/review` (`dotfiles/docs/adr/0028-ship-command-as-synthesis-gate.md`) — dispatches nobody, synthesizes `/review`'s findings and verification status, checks the axes no persona owns (infrastructure, documentation), and issues the GO/NO-GO verdict with a mandatory rollback plan. `/explain` sits outside the gates: it renders a candidate's spec, plan, diff and gate messages as one offline HTML review page under `.git/explain/` — requirement trace, touched modules, blind-reviewer's reading next to the goal, open findings, rollback — and changes nothing (`dotfiles/docs/adr/0069-plain-writing-explain-page-and-generated-map.md`). The former `/ai-assistant`, `/langchain-agent`, `/prompt-optimize` vendored commands come from the installed and globally enabled `llm-application-dev@claude-code-workflows` plugin
- `dotfiles/claude/references/` -> `~/.claude/references/` (whole directory) — shared checklists (`definition-of-done.md`, `security-checklist.md`) that the SDLC skills point at with a `../../references/` path, `documentation-practices.md` (the Ideas/Decisions/Memory practice moved out of `CLAUDE.md` so it isn't force-loaded into every subagent), `reviewer-triggers.md` (the single trigger-condition matrix `/review` reads when dispatching specialist reviewers), `repository-precedent.md` (how to use a `repo-recon` report and what to do when there is no precedent — previously restated in `/spec`, `/plan` and `spec-driven-development`; the evidence order itself stayed inline in `spec-driven-development` because it is five lines needed on nearly every run, and `repository-precedent-example.md` holds the worked report separately for the same reason — see `dotfiles/docs/adr/0048-repository-precedent-placement-corrected.md`), `spec-quality-gates.md` and `plan-quality-gates.md` (the single sources for closure checks, approval state, id ownership, the invariant-mechanism and data-lifecycle gates, and the `REQ-###` trace from `/spec` through `/ship` — the plan side also carries spec-revision pinning via `git hash-object` and the rules for bounded spike tasks; several consumers, one copy each, same reason as `reviewer-triggers.md`), `agent-run-metrics.md` (lightweight actual-only signals for tuning executor/workstream/model policy), and `templates/` (`spec.md`, `bugfix-spec.md`, `plan.md`, `task.md` — the canonical document shapes `spec-driven-development`/`planning-and-task-breakdown` point at instead of embedding their own copy, so the two skills can't drift apart on format either; `bugfix-spec.md` leads with reproduction evidence and makes preserved behavior its own requirement — see `dotfiles/docs/adr/0045-spec-approval-state-change-impact-and-requirement-traceability.md`); must stay a sibling of `skills/`, not nested inside it
- `dotfiles/claude/hooks/` -> `~/.claude/hooks/` (whole directory) — scripts referenced by `settings.json`'s `hooks` key: destructive-bash blocking (`rm -rf`, block-device writes, recursive chmod/chown, and the git equivalents — `reset --hard`, `clean -f`, `branch -D`, `checkout .`/`restore .`), and a force-push-to-main/master warning plus a plain-push confirm in local IDE sessions (`$CLAUDE_CODE_REMOTE` unset). Both hooks expand the `dotfiles/.gitconfig` aliases that reach those commands (`rlc`, `co`, `fu`, and the `push` typo family) before matching, since a grep for the spelled-out command lets every alias through; keep the two lists in sync when that `[alias]` section changes. The worktree startup/dispatch hooks share `worktree-readiness.sh`: projects may expose a fast, nonmutating `bin/worktree-doctor.sh --infrastructure`; stale or missing ticket infrastructure warns on startup and denies writing dispatch, including mid-ticket. Sequential executors inherit the ticket checkout; concurrent dispatch explicitly requests isolation (see `dotfiles/docs/adr/0058-sequential-ticket-checkout-and-infrastructure-readiness.md`). Three further hooks are **agent-scoped** — declared in `executor.md` and `test-engineer.md` frontmatter, not in `settings.json` — so they run only while those writing personas run: `block-agent-push.sh` hard-denies every spelling of `git push` and the `gh` commands that push or publish (local commits and tags stay allowed), `require-commit-trailers.sh` denies a commit whose new message has no `Refs: <TICKET>` trailer (`dotfiles/docs/adr/0081-spec-plan-checks-and-trailer-hook.md`), and `require-handoff-report.sh` (a `SubagentStop` hook) refuses to let the persona finish until its report carries verification outcomes, a commit id, and the working-tree state — see `dotfiles/docs/adr/0055-multi-agent-enforcement-and-parallel-when-safe.md`. `settings.json` also pins `CLAUDE_CODE_MAX_SUBAGENT_SPAWN_DEPTH=1` (no subagent can spawn another), `CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS=0` (a named subagent never silently becomes a teammate without worktree isolation), and `CLAUDE_CODE_FORK_SUBAGENT=0` (Claude cannot spawn a conversation fork that inherits the main session's full context and tool pool; `/subtask` still works when you start one yourself)
- `dotfiles/claude/docs/` -> `~/.claude/docs/` (whole directory) — `agents.md`: the persona/orchestration reference (roster, `/build`→`/test`→`/review` shapes, context-discipline, adding-a-persona checklist), made available at runtime instead of living only in `dotfiles/docs/` (which holds repo-specific meta-documentation — ADRs, IDEAS.md, MEMORY.md — that has no reason to sync to every machine's `~/.claude/`)
- `dotfiles/codex/config.toml` -> `~/.codex/config.toml` — `sandbox_mode = "workspace-write"` with `[sandbox_workspace_write] network_access = true`: writes confined to the workspace (`.git`/`.agents`/`.codex` read-only inside it), network kept on for npx/composer/remote MCP. The `[desktop]`, `[projects]`, `[plugins.*]` and `[mcp_servers.node_repl]` blocks are written by the Codex app itself, so they churn per machine — that's expected noise in `git status`, not config to hand-edit
- `dotfiles/codex/rules/harness.rules` -> `~/.codex/rules/harness.rules` — curated per-command approval rules, generic across machines and projects. These are convenience, not a security boundary: `sandbox_mode` is what enforces. `~/.codex/rules/default.rules` is deliberately **not** synced: Codex writes every TUI approval there, and while it was a symlink into this repo, one-off approvals and the blanket `sed -n` removed in `dotfiles/docs/adr/0044-config-security-hardening-pass.md` flowed back into git. The linker retires that old link, keeping any approvals written through it as a local file — see `dotfiles/docs/adr/0062-codex-rules-curated-file-separate-from-approvals.md`
- `dotfiles/claude/AGENTS.md` -> `~/.codex/AGENTS.md` — the same shared global working rules, without a second source copy.
- `dotfiles/codex/agents/` -> `~/.codex/agents/` — eight native Codex roles reusing the shared persona bodies. Executor, test-engineer, and repo-recon use Terra/xhigh; four reviewers and executor-high use Astra/high. Native roles disable nested delegation and attach role policies; recon/review default to a read-only sandbox.
- `dotfiles/codex/hooks/` -> `~/.codex/hooks/` and `dotfiles/codex/hooks.json` -> `~/.codex/hooks.json` — Codex adapters for the shared destructive-command, push, worktree/readiness, isolated-test-runner, startup, and writer-handoff guards. Hooks require Codex trust review before they run; these are accident guards on supported tool paths, not a complete security boundary.
- `dotfiles/codex/references/` -> `~/.codex/references/` — Codex invocation, model routing, independent context, hook activation, and runtime compatibility instructions.
- `dotfiles/codex/skills/*` -> `~/.agents/skills/*` (individual links) — Codex adapters for all 19 committed skills under `dotfiles/claude/skills` and all 7 commands (`$spec`, `$plan`, `$build`, `$test`, `$review`, `$ship`, `$explain`). They read the maintained Claude commands, skill bodies, agents, references, and templates through relative source paths. `dotfiles/codex/references/workflow-runtime.md` maps invocation, skill loading, and agent orchestration to Codex. `agents/openai.yaml` makes these explicit-only (`allow_implicit_invocation: false`): the six stage entry points and `$explain`, the standalone incremental and code-review skills, and `executor-development-discipline`, `spec-driven-development` and `planning-and-task-breakdown`, which only a stage or a role loads. `dotfiles/tools/tests/test-codex-harness.py` checks that set and that each adapter's description matches its Claude skill. Claude model names and MCP settings are not imported; native Codex roles and hook adapters provide the client-specific layer. Tool-dependent skills still require callable Codex tools. Codex's bundled `~/.codex/skills/.system` remains untouched.

The main `dotfiles/tools/setup/link_dotfiles.sh` setup calls the Codex installer. To install
or repeat only the Codex skill setup, run `python3 dotfiles/codex/install-skills.py`
from the repository root. The main setup preflights every destination before
mutation, refuses to overwrite an existing `.bak`, and reverts paths changed by
the current run if a later link fails. The Codex installer likewise preflights
conflicts and rolls back adapter links created by a failed run.
`python3 dotfiles/codex/install-skills.py --check` verifies installed link targets
without changing files; it does not test model behavior or connector access.
Use `--dest PATH` for an isolated installation check. Links point at this checkout,
so rerun setup on each machine at its actual checkout location.

After changing native agents or hooks, start a new Codex session and review/trust
the new definitions in CLI `/hooks`, including role-layer hooks when surfaced.
Untrusted hooks are skipped. On a surface without a native-role selector, the
workflow passes the model and persona explicitly, but role-specific hooks and
sandbox defaults do not load; the runtime reference documents that limitation.
Live parent permission overrides can also supersede role sandbox defaults.
`python3 dotfiles/tools/tests/test-codex-harness.py` checks real Git fixtures, installed hook
commands, and role declarations without spending model tokens. See
[ADR 0059](docs/adr/0059-codex-native-roles-and-hook-adapters.md).

Superpowers, Code Simplifier, and Commit Commands remain installed/known for
project-scoped opt-in but are not globally enabled. Qdrant and LLM Application
Dev remain globally enabled; see
`dotfiles/docs/adr/0039-runtime-catalog-narrowed-by-observed-use.md`.

Since these are symlinks, editing the file in the repo or letting the app
edit it live (e.g. `/model`, `codex mcp add`) are the same thing — just
`git status` in this repo afterwards to see what changed, and commit when
you want to snapshot it. Adding a new agent/skill/hook file needs no script
change (whole directories are linked) — see
`dotfiles/claude/skills/dotfiles-sync/SKILL.md` for the full checklist.

MCP servers: **not symlinked** — see `dotfiles/claude/mcp/setup.sh`. Run it
by hand once per machine (`./dotfiles/claude/mcp/setup.sh`, no secrets needed);
`claude mcp add` writes into `~/.claude.json`, which mixes server config with
per-project trust state and can carry OAuth tokens/API keys, so it belongs
in the "not synced" list below, not linked like the rest. The script writes
auth headers as literal `${GITHUB_TOKEN}`/`${APIFY_TOKEN}`/`${CONTEXT7_API_KEY}` placeholders
that Claude Code expands at load time, so the stored config holds variable
names rather than tokens — export those variables in the shell that starts
Claude Code. One exception: with `CONTEXT7_API_KEY` unset, Context7 is added
with no auth header at all (its unauthenticated rate limit), and a later rerun
skips it as already configured — so export the key before the first run if you
want the higher limit. Re-running the script skips any server that already exists
instead of aborting on the first duplicate name.

The script also adds Chrome DevTools MCP (`chrome-devtools-mcp@1.10.1`,
`--isolated`, a throwaway Chrome profile per run) for real-browser checks.
Only `test-engineer` holds its tools; executors have none, so `/build` lists
browser-dependent criteria as `Needs real-browser check` and `/review` routes
them to `/test` (`dotfiles/docs/adr/0070-browser-checks-route-to-test-engineer.md`). It
needs Node 20+ and a local Chrome. The Codex config pins the same version; bump
both together.

The filesystem MCP server is deliberately **not** configured. At user scope
rooted on `$HOME` it reached around `settings.json`'s `Read` deny paths
(`~/.ssh`, `~/.aws`, `~/.config/gh`, `~/.git-credentials`) — that deny list
constrains Claude Code's own file tools, not an MCP server — while the built-in
`Read`/`Write`/`Glob`/`Grep` tools already cover the workspace. Run
`claude mcp remove filesystem` on a machine that still has it.

Deliberately **not** synced:
- `~/.claude.json` — MCP server config (user/local scope) plus per-project trust
  state and possible OAuth tokens/API keys. Use `dotfiles/claude/mcp/setup.sh`
  to reproduce the MCP servers on a new machine instead.
- `~/.claude/.credentials.json` — OAuth tokens, machine-specific secrets.
- `~/.claude/plugins/installed_plugins.json`, `known_marketplaces.json` — regenerated
  automatically from `settings.json`'s `enabledPlugins` / `extraKnownMarketplaces`.
- `dotfiles/claude/skills/synced/`, `dotfiles/claude/skills/session-start-hook/`
  (gitignored) — Claude Code's own bundled/example skills (docx, pdf, pptx, xlsx,
  skill-creator, morning, session-start-hook), auto-materialized inside the
  symlinked `skills/` directory whenever one gets listed as available in a
  session. Same "regenerated automatically" category as the plugin files above,
  just written into a path this repo otherwise curates deliberately.
- `~/.claude/{projects,sessions,cache,downloads,shell-snapshots,file-history,
  session-env,backups,ide,daemon,jobs,paste-cache}`, `~/.claude/history.jsonl`,
  `~/.claude/policy-limits.json`, `~/.claude/.last-*` — runtime state/logs, not config.
- `~/.codex/{sessions,shell_snapshots,tmp,.tmp,mcp-oauth-locks}`, the `*.sqlite*`
  state/memory/log/goals databases, `installation_id` — runtime state, machine-specific.
- `~/.codex/skills/.system/*` — vendor-shipped system skills bundled with Codex itself,
  not user config.
- `~/.ai/mcp/mcp.json` — currently empty (0 bytes), nothing to sync yet.
- `~/.config/superpowers/` — the `episodic-memory` plugin's archived conversation
  transcripts and local SQLite/vector index. Rebuilds itself from `~/.claude/projects`
  and `~/.codex/sessions` on each machine; nothing here is worth carrying over, and
  transcripts can hold anything that was ever pasted into a session.
